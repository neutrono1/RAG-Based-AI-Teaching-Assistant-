  "text": " In the previous lecture which was the first problem on multiple transformations, we followed the priority order to obtain the multiple transformed signal. But in the second problem, which you can see on your screen, we will not follow the priority order. There are three different methods by using which you can obtain the multiple transformed signal. In the method number one, we will use the shortcut. And by using the shortcut, you will have your waveform, the transformed waveform in one step only. In the second method, we will perform scaling first and then shifting. And in the third method, we will perform shifting first and then scaling. So let's see how we can solve this problem. In this problem, signal xt is the input signal and the waveform you can see. And it is given to a system represented by this rectangular box. And the output of the system is yt which is equal to x-2t plus 1. So the original signal was xt and after performing the transformations using this system, the output is x-2t plus 1. And if you compare these two signals, you can see there are multiple transformations. I can see time shifting. I can see time scaling. And I can also see time reversal. This minus sign shows there is time reversal occurred because of this system. And we need to perform these three operations to obtain the output signal. But in examinations, when you have four options given, you can directly follow the shortcut method to obtain your answer. So let's discuss the method number one in which we will follow the shortcut method. In shortcut method, we first draw the waveform in which the y-axis is of the output signal x-2t plus 1. But the x-axis which is the time axis, we change it to minus 2t plus 1. Whatever is there inside this bracket, we change the x-axis to it. So minus 2t plus 1 is the x-axis. And if I consider minus 2t plus 1 as alpha, let's say it is alpha, then this axis here will be alpha. So x of alpha is the y-axis and alpha is the x-axis which is similar to x of t and t. So the waveform of this signal will be similar to the waveform of the input signal. So we can have the waveform same as the input signal like this. At 0, the amplitude is 1. This is minus 3, this is 6 and this is origin. So this is how we complete the first step in the shortcut method. Now in the next step, we will try to have t in the x-axis because the output signal is yt and the independent variable is time t, not minus 2t plus 1. So we need t in the x-axis. So we need to change minus 2t plus 1 to t. And how we can do it? We can simply subtract minus 1 from minus 2t plus 1 and this will give us minus 2t. And then we will divide minus 2t by 2 to have minus t. And again we will multiply minus t by minus 1 or you can say by performing the time reversal, we will have t. So these are all the steps we need to do to obtain t in the x-axis. So let's do them one by one. I will write down all the steps. This is step number 1, this is step number 2 and this is step number 3. So in step number 1, we are subtracting 1. So let's subtract 1 from minus 3, 1 from 6 and we also need to subtract 1 from 0 because if you remember the important point and shortcut method lecture on multiple transformations, we did not perform the operations at 0 because the amplitude was constant there. We had the rectangular waveform and the amplitude was constant. But here there is change in the amplitude at 0, that's why we are required to perform the transformations at 0 also. So this is one important point in the shortcut and because of which we will subtract 1 from 0. And this will give us, this will give us minus 4, minus 1 and 5. This is after completing the first step. Now in the second step, we are dividing the x-axis by 2. So let's divide the x-axis by 2. I will divide minus 4 by 2, minus 1 by 2 and 5 by 2. This will give me minus 2, minus 0.5 and 2.5. We are done with step number 2. Let's move to the final step in which we will perform the time reversal. We will multiply the x-axis by minus 1. So when you multiply minus 1 and minus 2, you will get 2. Minus 0.5 multiplied with minus 1 is 0.5 and 2.5 will become minus 2.5. In this way, we have converted the x-axis from minus 2t plus 1 to t and now we can easily plot the output waveform. So let's do it quickly. yt which is x minus 2t plus 1 and this axis is time axis. At t equal to 2, the signal is equal to 0. At t equal to 0.5, the signal is 1. Let's say this is 0.5, the signal is equal to 1 and at t equal to minus 2.5, the signal is again equal to 0. This is minus 2.5, the signal is 0. Now we will join these three points to get the final waveform. So this is the answer of this problem and this amplitude here is equal to 1. So you can see it is very easy to obtain the final waveform using the shortcut method. All these calculations I have done to explain you the process. Once you practice few more questions using the shortcut method, you can directly write down the answers. Now let's move to method number 2 in which we will perform scaling first and then we will perform the shifting. The original signal is xt and we will perform time scaling and after performing time scaling, the new signal is x2t. And we know what we need to do in case of time scaling. As the multiplied number is 2 which is greater than 1, there is compression of the signal and we have obtained minus 1.5 and 3 by dividing minus 3 by 2 and 6 by 2. In the next step, we will perform the time shifting or you can perform the time reversal first. Even if you can perform the time reversal after performing the time shifting, it is up to you. Time reversal is not that complicated to perform. We only have to take the mirror image about the y-axis. So let's do it quickly. We will obtain the mirror image about the y-axis. So this is how the signal will look once you perform the time reversal. And now we will perform the final operation which is time shifting. So we have x minus 2t and we want x minus 2t plus 1. Now this is an important step. As I told you, whenever you perform any operation, you have to look at the x-axis. x minus 2t plus 1 and the x-axis is t. But here the shifting which is by 1 is performed against minus 2t but the x-axis here is t. So we cannot perform the shifting by 1 against minus 2t. So we need to separate the time t so that we can perform the shifting. Let's do it. From here, we can have x. I will take minus to common. This will give me t minus 1 by 2 or 0.5. And in that way we have separated the t and now you can see we are performing the shifting by 0.5 and the shift will be right because there is minus sign against time t. So let's do it quickly. We will shift this waveform by 0.5 towards the right. So when you shift minus 3 by 0.5 towards the right, you will have minus 2.5. When you shift 0 towards the right by 0.5, you will have 0.5 and 1.5 will become 2. At minus 2.5, signal is 0. At 2, signal is 0. But at 0.5, signal is 1. Join these three points and you will get the final waveform. And if you compare these two waveforms, you will find they are same. So by using the method number 2, you can get the answer as well. Now let us discuss the final method, the third method in which we will perform the time shifting first. So the signal is xt and we will perform the time shifting first and this will give us xt plus 1. Now here if you see the output signal which is x minus 2t plus 1, the shifting is by 1 and if you are performing the shifting first, then you have to perform it against time t. So we will perform the shifting against time t. xt plus 1t, in this case the signal was x minus 2t before performing the time shifting and in this case the signal is xt before performing the time shifting. So there is no need to separate the time t in this case because it is already separated and we are performing the shifting against t. But here in this case, the time was multiplied by minus 2, that's why it was important to separate the time t before performing the shifting to get the correct waveform. So we don't have to worry about any separation in this case, we will directly shift the signal towards the left by 1. And to do this, we need to see the original signal. This is the original signal and we will shift it towards the left by 1. This is what you will get once you shift the signal towards the left by 1. So we are done with the first step in method no.3 and now we will perform the time scaling. We will perform the time scaling of xt plus 1, time scaling and the obtained signal is x2t plus 1. The compression of the signal will take place. So we will divide minus 4 by 2, minus 1 by 2 and 5 by 2. And in that way we will have the waveform which will look like this. Now we will perform the time reversal, x2t plus 1. After performing the time reversal, we will have x minus 2t plus 1. We will take the mirror image about the y-axis. So this is the waveform of signal yt and if you compare this waveform with the two waveforms we have obtained here and here, it will be same. So in all the three methods, we have obtained the same answer and I hope this process is clear to you. If you have any doubt, you may ask in the comment section. I will end this lecture here. See you in the next one."
