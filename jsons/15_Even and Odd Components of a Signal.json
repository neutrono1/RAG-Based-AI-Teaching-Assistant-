  "text": " In this lecture we will find even and odd components of a signal. Any continuous time signal can be represented as sum of odd and even components. Any continuous time signal can be represented as sum of odd and even components and by using this property we will find even and odd components. A general signal is neither even nor odd but have both even and odd components. Let's say, let's say Xt is the continuous time signal. The even component of signal Xt is represented by X subscript e, t and the odd component is represented by X subscript o, t. This is the even component of signal Xt and this is the odd component of signal Xt and from this property continuous time signal can be represented as sum of odd and even components so we can write, we can write continuous time signal Xt equal to even component plus the odd component and let's say this is equation number one. Now we will put t equal to minus t in equation number one. t equal to minus t means we will perform folding or time reversal in equation number one and this will give us, this will give us X minus t equal to X e minus t plus X o minus t. X e minus t is equal to X et and X o minus t is equal to minus X ot. We have already completed these things in the last lecture so X minus t is equal to X et minus X ot and let's say this equation is equation number two and by using these two equations we will find even component and the odd component of continuous time signal Xt. To find out even component we will add equation number one and equation number two. We will add the first equation and the second equation. On the left hand side we will have Xt plus X minus t and on the right hand side we will have twice of X et because X ot and minus X ot will cancel out so X et, the even component is equal to one by two inside the bracket Xt plus X minus t. So this is the expression of the even component and by using this we can easily calculate the even component of the signal Xt. Now we will find out the odd component and to do this we will subtract equation number two from equation number one. We will subtract the second equation from the first equation and this will give us Xt minus X minus t on the left hand side and on the right hand side we will have twice of X ot therefore therefore X ot, the odd component is equal to one by two inside the bracket Xt minus X minus t. So this is the expression of the odd component and we can easily calculate the odd component like the even component and these two expressions are very important. In the coming presentations we will solve various problems using the expression of even component and the expression of odd component. So this is all for this lecture if you have any doubt you may ask in the comment section."
