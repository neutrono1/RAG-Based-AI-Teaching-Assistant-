  "text": " In this lecture we will study multiple transformations of continuous time signals. We have already completed scaling, shifting and reversal of continuous time signals and when we apply two or more of these three basic operations simultaneously, we call it multiple transformations of continuous time signals. In exam you will have problems based on multiple transformations as it includes all the three basic operations. So multiple transformation is an important topic and I will explain step by step process to solve the problems having the multiple transformations. Let's take one example. In this example, XT is the original signal or the signal given in the problem and by using XT we have to find out or plot signal yt which is equal to capital A small x inside the bracket minus t minus t0 or t0 divided by small a. So this is what we have as the signal yt which we have to find or plot using the given signal xt. Let's see what are the steps involved to find out signal yt. In step number one, in step number one we have to divide minus t by a separately and minus t0 by a separately. So yt is equal to capital A x inside the bracket minus t divided by a minus t0 divided by a. So this is what we have to do in step number one. In step number two, in step number two we have to plot xt. Xt is the original signal and it is already given in the problem. Xt is given in the problem. In step number three we have to plot capital A xt. In step number three we have to plot capital A xt and you can clearly see this process is the process of amplitude scaling because we are multiplying A, we are multiplying A to the original signal xt. So step number three is the process of amplitude scaling. Now we will move to the step number four. Step number four, in step number four we need to plot, we need to plot capital A x minus t and you can clearly see this is the process of time reversal because we are having minus t in place of t. This means we are multiplying, we are multiplying alpha to the t where alpha is equal to minus 1 and when alpha is equal to minus 1 the process is called as time reversal. Multiplying alpha is the process of time scaling but when alpha is equal to minus 1 it is the process of time reversal. So I will write this down. Step number four is the process of time reversal. Step number five, step number five will have the plot of A x inside the bracket minus t minus t0 by A. So you can see we have time shifting, we are subtracting t0 by A from minus t. So step number five is the process of time shifting. Now we will move to the last step which is step number six. In step number six we will plot A x inside the bracket minus t divided by A minus t0 by A. If you compare these two signals you will find we have multiplied minus t. by 1 by A. So step number six is the process of time scaling. Step number six is the process of time scaling because we are multiplying 1 by A to minus t. In order to get the correct plot you have to follow this sequence. First you need to write down yt in this form. Then you have to plot the original signal xt. After this we will plot A xt where A is multiplied to the original signal. So it is the process of amplitude scaling. We can perform amplitude scaling at any time. It is not important to perform it in step number three. In step number four we have performed the time reversal in which we have converted time t to minus t. In step number five we have performed time shifting in which we have subtracted t0 by A from minus t and in the last step we have performed time scaling by multiplying 1 by A to minus t. This sequence, this sequence from step number four to step number six must not change. So I will separately write down the priority order. The priority order. The first priority is given to the time reversal. First you need to perform the time reversal. After this you have to perform the time shifting. Then you can perform the time scaling. Time scaling and you can perform amplitude scaling at any time. So this is all for this lecture. Multiple transformations is an important topic and you have to follow this priority order then only you will have the correct waveform. In the next lecture we will solve examples based on multiple transformations."
